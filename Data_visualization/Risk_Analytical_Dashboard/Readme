It simulates **risk feature analysis**, **customer segmentation**, and **model explainability** with a credit risk or data science context.

- Demonstrates exploratory analysis of variables before model building  
- Aligns with scorecard model interpretability (IV, WOE, etc.)  
- Suitable with risk, analytics, or credit-modeling portfolios  

**key charts:**
- Doughnut & Pie Charts – categorical distribution visualization  
- Bar Charts – variable contribution analysis  
- Average Price Benchmark Line – threshold comparison for risk or performance levels
